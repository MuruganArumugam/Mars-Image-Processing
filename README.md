# Mars-Image-Processing

In this project assignment, we are going to see how we are going to obtain good picture of Mars using appropriate image processing tool.

In this project assignment , we are going to process the image by using registax6 , AutoStakkert ( version 3.1.4 ) and Adobe Photoshop.

Source of planetary data**

The source of data is a live video of Planet Mars captured on Sep30,2020.          ( Video size : 1.7 GB )

The source planetary data is in RAW8 format which is captured using sharpcap. 

Sharpcap is an easy-to-use and powerful astronomy camera capture tool. It can be used with dedicated astronomy cameras.

Telescope Used:  Celestron 14‚Äù Edge HD( 3910mm focal length )

It used Televue Powermate 2x which multiplies telescope focal length twice.

It also used ZWO ADC which is a atmospheric distortion/dispersion corrector.

The planetary Camera used is ZWO ASI 290 MC.

It also captured using PHD2 , which is a telescope guiding software that simplifies the process of tracing a guide star, letting you concentrate on other aspects of deep-sky imaging or spectroscopy.
